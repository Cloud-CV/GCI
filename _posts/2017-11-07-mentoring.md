# Become a GCI Mentor!
Mentoring is very important to the future of CloudCV.
It introduces new people to the world of open source software
who will enrich our community with their ideas and talents.<br><br/>
Apart from technical skills, being a mentor requires your time, a clear roadmap for your project and good organization skills. If you think you would be a good fit to mentor one of our projects, do reach out to us!
