Having an **embedded media** (photos and video) is often inflexible with a dynamic and **responsive design**.

### Embed your video like this:
{: .left}

It'll play like this funny video below! Try resizing the page!

Photo layouts are also really cool and dynamically resizable. Check out the photos/gallery section at [magiciansanfrancisco.com](http://magiciansanfrancisco.com) for a demo and see [the source code](https://github.com/strongrobert/MagicianSanFrancisco) for how.
