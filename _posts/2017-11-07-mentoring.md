# Become a Mentor!
Mentoring is very important to the future of CloudCV.
It introduces new people to the world of open source software
who will enrich our community with their ideas and talents.<br><br/>
Apart from technical skills, being a mentor requires your time, a clear roadmap for your project and good organization skills. If you think you would be a good fit to mentor one of our projects, do reach out to us!
