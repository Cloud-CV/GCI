**CloudCV** website had a lot of legacy code that needed to be cleaned. Our GSoC 2017 student, <a href="https://github.com/uttu357">Utkarsh Gupta</a> implemented the new website which will be deployed in few weeks. The goal of this project is to support all the other infrastructural needs for other projects like EvalAI, Fabrik and Origami etc. We also want to make this website as informative as possible for the new contributors. So, we are looking for contributors like you to make it even easier for new contributors to get started with our projects and contribute to open source.
