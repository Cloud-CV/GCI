<p><strong>EvalAI</strong> is an open source web application that helps researchers, students and data-scientists to create, collaborate and participate in various AI challenges organized round the globe. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable &amp; accurate quantitative analysis.
